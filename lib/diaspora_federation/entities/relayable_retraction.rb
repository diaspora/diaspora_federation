    # There are two cases of federation of the RelayableRetraction.
    # Retraction from the dowstream object owner is when an author of the
    # relayable (e.g. Comment) deletes it themself. In this case only target_author_signature
    # is filled and a retraction is sent to the commented post's author. Here
    # the upstream object owner signs it with the parent's author key, puts
    # the signature in parent_author_signature and sends it to other pods where
    # other participating people are present. This is the second case - retraction
    # from the upstream object owner.
    # Retraction from the upstream object owner can also be performed by the
    # upstream object owner themself - they have a right to delete comments on their posts.
    # In any case in the retraction by the upstream author target_author_signature
    # is not checked, only parent_author_signature is checked.
